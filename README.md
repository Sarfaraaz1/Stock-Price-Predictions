# Stock Price Prediction Model

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a machine learning model that predicts stock prices using historical data from Yahoo Finance. A Random Forest Regressor was used to forecast the next day's closing price. The project also includes visualizations of the actual vs. predicted prices to showcase the model's performance.

## Features
- Fetches historical stock price data using the `yfinance` library.
- Implements a Random Forest Regressor for predictions.
- Visualizes actual vs. predicted prices with Matplotlib.
- Provides a clean and reproducible codebase for stock price prediction.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:  
  - `yfinance`: Fetch stock market data.  
  - `Pandas`: Data manipulation and preparation.  
  - `scikit-learn`: Machine learning (Random Forest Regressor).  
  - `Matplotlib`: Data visualization.  

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-prediction.git

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with other machine learning models.
- Incorporate additional features like trading volume or technical indicators (e.g., moving averages).
